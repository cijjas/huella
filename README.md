## About This Project

This website serves as a digital memorial and historical archive dedicated to preserving the collective memory of the Tren del Bajo, also known as "La Vía Muerta" (The Dead Track). Through an interactive mapping experience, we aim to document and share the stories, testimonies, and photographic evidence that tell the history of this important railway infrastructure in Buenos Aires.

## Mission

The Tren del Bajo represents more than abandoned railway tracks—it embodies decades of urban history, social transformation, and community memory. This project seeks to:

- **Preserve Historical Memory**: Safeguard the stories and testimonies of those who lived, worked, and were impacted by the Tren del Bajo before they are lost to time.

- **Document Physical Heritage**: Create a comprehensive visual and textual record of the railway's infrastructure, mapping its route and documenting its current state.

- **Foster Community Engagement**: Provide a platform where community members can explore and understand the historical significance of this urban space.

- **Support Historical Research**: Offer researchers, urban planners, and historians a structured database of geolocated historical information.
